	midcor is an R program that performs a primary analysis of isotopic isomers (isotopomers) distribution obtained by Gas Cromatography coupled with Mass Spectrometry (GCMS). The aim of this analysis is to have a corrected distribution of isotopes originated from substrates that are artificially enriched with specific isotopes (usually 13C). To this end the program performs a correction for natural occurring isotopes and also correction for “impurities” of the assay media that give peaks overlapping with the spectra of analyzed labeled metabolites. This program offers two ways of corrections of “impurities” resulted from overlapping the assayed mass isotopomer distribution with peaks produced either by unknown metabolites in the media, or by different fragments produced by the assayed metabolite.
